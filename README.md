A compilation of language agents using the üê®[Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427) framework. 

## üê®CoALA Overview
CoLLA neatly specifies a langauge agent starting with its **action space**, which has 2 parts:
* External actions to interact with external environments (**grounding**)
* Internal actions to interact with internal memories (**reasoning**, **retrieval**, **learning**)
  * A language agent has a short-term working memory and several long-term memories (episodic for experience, semantic for knowledge, procedural for code/LLM)
  * **Reasoning** = update working memory (with LLM)
  * **Retrieval** = read long-term memory
  * **Learning** = write long-term memory

Then how does a language agent choose which action to take? Its actions are structured into **decision making** cycles, and each cycle has two stages:
* **Planning**: The agent applies reasoning/retrieval actions to (iteratively) propose and evaluate actions, then select a learning/grounding action.
* **Execution**: The selected learning/grounding action is executed to affect the internal memory or external world.
